                        <p>"Let that sink in," Elon Musk posted after acquiring Twitter for $42 billion, sharing a photo of himself carrying a bathroom sink into headquarters with a goofy grin (<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1585341984679469056">here on X</a>). Under his leadership as a self-proclaimed free speech advocate, political polarization on social media has surged. This trend of deregulating social media platforms took another turn after Trump's re-election, placing Musk in the administration (<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854034776815972649">his announcement on this, again on X</a>) and bringing his deregulation agenda into the Oval Office. Other tech leaders, notably Mark Zuckerberg, have followed suit, announcing major policy shifts that will reshape platform interfaces and cultures (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEhf2uTJUs0/">Zuckerkerbergs Instagram announcement</a>).</p>
                        <p>Stepping back, these changes unfold in a critical election year – 2024 – where over four billion people across 64 countries, including the EU, are set to vote (<a href="#ewe-2023">Ewe, 2023</a>, <a href="#reece-2024">Reece, 2024</a>). Meanwhile, political polarization in developed nations has intensified for decades (<a href="#mccoy-etal-2022">McCoy et al., 2022</a>), with the World Economic Forum ranking it as the third-largest global risk for 2024, right after mis- and disinformation (<a href="#wef-2024">WEF, 2024</a>). In the U.S., a decade of deepening division has made its impact especially clear in this election cycle (<a href="#kleinfeld-2023">Kleinfeld, 2023</a>).</p>
                        <p>McCoy & Press (<a href="#mccoy-press-2022">2022</a>) highlight that rising political polarization has led to democratic decline in half of the affected democracies since 1950. Social media platforms like X amplify this divide, making their design – interfaces, algorithms, and interaction patterns – crucial in shaping public discourse. This raises questions about responsibility and the role of designers in mitigating polarization.</p>
                            

                        <p>Our research examines how X’s interface contributes to political polarization and explores how speculative design can disrupt these patterns to reshape political content consumption. To do so, we distinguish interface-driven influences from broader psychological, sociological, and algorithmic factors, which remain deeply interconnected. We identified four key problem areas: 
                            <emphasis>Engagement-centric Design</emphasis>, 
                            <emphasis>Content Structure</emphasis>, 
                            <emphasis>Trust & Truth</emphasis>, and 
                            <emphasis>Hate Speech</emphasis>. 
                            Among these, Engagement-centric Design stood out as the most interesting factor in polarization. For this reason, we focused on critically analyzing and rethinking engagement-driven design patterns through speculative design approaches.</p>

                        <p class="small-title">What is engagement and what about its time consuming aspect?</p>
                        <p>Boosting user engagement is the lifeblood of platforms like X. Since most of these services are free to use and rely on ad revenue, their business models hinge on maximizing user and content visibility. The goal is to keep you glued to the app for as long as possible (<a href="#center-humane-technology-2021">Center for Humane Technology, 2021</a>).  In essence, your attention becomes the currency these companies thrive on. A world where your time, focus, and mental energy are commodified to power the revenue engine of social networking giants (<a href="#burkeman-2019">Burkeman, 2019</a>).</p>
                        <p class="small-title">How is engagement-centric design implemented?</p>
                        <p>Engagement-centric design works on multiple levels, but at its core, it’s about interaction. Let’s break it down into three key strategies. First, platforms lean heavily on simple interactions – think likes and comments – which are designed to keep you coming back for more (<a href="#stroud-muddiman-scacco-2013">Stroud, Muddiman & Scacco, 2013</a>). Then, there’s the all-important notification system. A 2023 study (<a href="#bell-etal-2023">Bell et al., 2023</a>)  found that users who received notifications were 3.5 times more likely to open the app within the next hour, compared to those who didn’t. So your phone’s constant buzzing is definitely by design. Finally, the never-ending scroll – an infinite feed that subtly increases the time you spend on the platform – is another tactic. It’s especially relevant now, with short video formats taking over the social media world (<a href="#koc-2023">Koç, 2023</a>).</p>
                        <p class="small-title">What are the effects of these design patterns on polarisation?</p>
                        <p>The link between high engagement and political polarization in online discussions is largely driven by the amount of time spent on the platform. Users who spend more time on X are more exposed to radical, polarized, and hateful content (<a href="#national-institute-justice-2023">National Institute of Justice, 2023</a>).  They interact more with like-minded peers, creating feedback loops that reinforce their views – known as <emphasis>echo chambers</emphasis> or <emphasis>filter bubbles</emphasis> (<a href="#cinelli-etal-2021">Cinelli et al., 2021</a>), which we will explain further in the last chapter <emphasis><a href="#following-for-you">Following and For you</a></emphasis>. Additionally, higher engagement increases a user's reach (X explains the mechanics <a href="https://create.twitter.com/en/goals/engagement">here</a>). , encouraging more provocative content to trigger emotional reactions and drive interaction. In its extreme form, this leads to <emphasis>engagement farming</emphasis> where social media algorithms are manipulated to artificially boost likes, shares, and comments (<a href="#oestreicher-2024">Oestreicher, 2024</a>).</p>
                        <p>By unraveling the hidden mechanisms behind X’s interface and exploring speculative, design-driven interventions, we aim to unmask how thoughtful design can challenge polarization and reshape the way we engage with content online.</p>
                        <p>Now let’s look at these aforementioned features of X and disrupt the concrete interface design decisions that ultimately lead to an increased engagement with the platform.</p>

                        <h3> Approach of Intervention</h3>
                        <p>To achieve this, we first have to distinguish influences by interface design on political polarization from others, such as general psychological, sociological or algorithmic effects, which all however are interconnected. Linear “For you” feeds for example are an interface decision, fueled by algorithms that curate the content you will see. Hate speech is a general problem, however, can be empowered to emotionalizing design choices.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, we will lay out the different problem spheres that group sets of the existing features X offers, that take impact on polarization, whether positively or negatively. Those are first Engagement-centric Design, second the general Structure of Content or information architecture, third Trust and Truth and fourth Hate Speech. Inside those spheres we will analyze features twofold, once on their direct impact on polarization and once on their indirect impact. Latter could be a feature that increases engagement with the app, while engagement itself has a polarizing effect.</p>

                        <p>X offers a set of options that let you interact with another user’s post. Most prominently in social media, we look at “liking”, represented by a heart on X. As the names suggest, these are one-dimensional “black and white” reactions on a post, which leads to the thought of more diverse reactions. Another important functionality is reposting, formerly retweeting, with which users can share posts with or without commenting on them in their own timeline and the feeds of their peers. Last, but maybe most well known for Twitter's (back then) discussion culture, we will discuss the threaded commenting functionality and propose alternative concepts that shed light on the polarizing effects the current implementation has on the community.</p>

                        <p>We tap the cute little heart icon, and before it turns red, it pulses and bursts into tiny sparkles. A small, satisfying reward – just enough to nudge us into liking more posts.</p>
                        <p>“This small action makes the experience more rewarding. It encourages users to interact with content,” Soegaard (<a href="#soegaard-2024">2024</a>) states. Dan Saffer (<a href="#saffer-2013">2013, p. 100</a>) agrees: “Interesting animations invite interaction” – but only when they follow five key principles: fast, smooth, natural, simple, and purposeful (Saffer, 2013, p. 99).</p>

Every user interaction adds load and forces them to wait just a fraction of a second before diving back into the endlessly numbing spell of the monotony of the feed. The user may pause and think twice before pressing the like button, questioning whether the post truly deserves a like or if liking has simply become an automatic, conditioned response.</p>

                        <h4>Diverse Reactions: Be that emoji</h4>
                        <p>Once more we take a look at the like button. At first glance, it might seem that social media platforms, like X, prominently display positive reactions to only discourage hate speech. However, it becomes evident that these platforms function in so-called „asymmetric feedback environments“ (<a href="#konovalova-2023">Konovalova, 2023</a>), where only positive reactions are counted and displayed, while there is no straightforward way to show or measure disapproval in forms of reactions. This imbalance in feedback has the consequence of extreme views and does not reflect a diverse atmospheric picture. Therefore it has a polarizing effect on content because ”social media platforms affect the expression of extreme opinions” (<a href="#konovalova-2023">Konovalova, 2023</a>).</p>
                        <p>As a solution, introducing personalized forms of feedback could help reduce polarization. The idea is that people would capture and share their actual facial expressions as reactions and use it like emojis on a post. This way users step out of the anonymous computer sump, moreover, it bridges the gap between online interactions and the “real world”. This hurdle will reduce mindless engagement as well as increase the emotional value of engagement that is left. Users would see a more democratic representation of reactions. It is more diverse and original and would also encourage every person reacting on X to review content in a responsible and self-conscious way, as their actual identity is revealed.</p>
                        <p>Aside from decreasing engagement, this feature would further take effect on polarisation twofold: First, on the segregation of users in echo chambers (more on that in Chapter 1.4 – <emphasis><a href="#for-you-and-following">For you and Following</a></emphasis>). As Kosheleva & Kreinovich (<a href="#kosheleva-kreinovich-2021">2021</a>) show “the echo chamber effect can be decreased if we simply replace the currently prevalent binary (yes-no) Like button on web pages with a more gradual (“fuzzy”) one – a button that will capture the relative degree of likeness“. Second, the interaction is more complex in cognitive load, time and self-awareness, which will, by adding friction, reduce mindless scrolling and increase the ability to recall viewed content (<a href="#ruiz-molinaleon-heuer-2024">Ruiz, Molina León & Heuer, 2024</a>).</p>

                        <h3>Reposting: Level up!</h3>
                        <p>Another problem with the way of getting engaged too easily, is the simplicity to repost content, which can lead to virality and an enormous speed of spreading information, as well as disinformation and fake news (more on that specific matter in chapter 3 – <emphasis><a href="#trust-and-truth">Trust and Truth</a></emphasis>). This has been a major challenge, especially throughout the COVID-pandemic. A study, published 2021 on PMC (<a href="#bermes-2021">Bermes</a>) examines how information overload and fake news sharing are connected. Looking at X's interface design it becomes quickly visible that users are only two taps away from reposting posts in their feed. </p>
                        <p>To make the repost feature more deliberate, we developed the idea of limiting the number of sharing options. Imagine having a reward-system which depicts your interaction tools on X. It’s essentially a gamified approach to content consumption inspired from video games when the player has limited resources like “Life”, “Energy” or “Items” play an inventory. If you have only two repost cards left in your digital wallet, you’ll think more carefully about which content is worth using them on. This system would encourage people to be more intentional about reposting, ensuring they read and evaluate posts before sharing them.This reduces the likelihood of spreading content which has not been checked twice and prioritizes content quality over quantity. The idea could also be extended to include the like and comment options within this system.</p>

                        <h4>Commenting: Who likes silence, anyway?</h4>
                        <p>When comparing different social media platforms, we see that only X (and its clones) prioritize commenting (replies) as the primary interaction in their layout. In contrast, platforms like Instagram and Facebook place likes at the forefront. Even discussion-focused apps like Threads or Reddit follow this "likes-first" approach. By prioritizing replies over likes, X actively emphasizes opinion sharing as it’s most important feature, encouraging users to express their own views. However, it can also contribute to several issues, particularly in the context of political polarization: Extreme or radical views, especially when they trigger strong reactions, are shown as the most popular comments under a post. This tends to garner more engagement, which can also lead to a post’s amplification. Beyond that, comments are stored indefinitely and offer to be engaged with, even if political context has changed.</p>
                        <p>So, how could we depolarize the comment section of a post and prevent users from drowning in a sea of comments? We analyzed how comments are stored under a post and found that it's similar to a large archive where the most prominent content is pushed to the top. Emotional outbursts and personal attacks are set in stone here permanently. <emphasis>Hate speech</emphasis>, as a result, becomes another major factor contributing to polarization on X, which we will explore further in Chapter 4 – <emphasis><a href="#emotionalizing-design">Emotionalizing Design</a></emphasis>.</p>
                        <p>Here, however, we focus on comments as reactions. Looking back at this comment archive, why not create a space more connected to reality by turning comments into a live discussion format? </p>
                        <p>As commenting in social media, is a metaphor for a discussion in real life, but stems from a time, when the internet was providing mostly textual content, we can rethink this in nowadays technological context: In a world of video, live streaming and constant connection, users could join a digital room for live video meetings, creating a setting where specific phrases cannot be isolated and used to frame or misrepresent conversations. We intend to create a more natural discussion-culture and prevent polarizing comments to define a post. Will there even be breakout rooms to imitate the iconic threaded structure of X? Could I just open a room, when I disagree with a specific side note in that discussion? </p>
                        <p>This video comment section would only be accessible to users willing to engage in active listening or open discussions with peers. In this way, it promotes a more mindful use of X and disengages users from superficial or toxic interactions, encouraging more meaningful, respectful exchanges. The fact, the discussion is brought into the present forces the users to solve their discussion now, instead of sending a statement into the void hoping for maximum engagement.</p>

Yet, some posts manage to skyrocket overnight, reaching hundreds of thousands of users in a remarkably short time. The statement or image you just shared suddenly becomes the talk of the town. However, this surge in visibility can come with its downsides, especially when viral content spreads misinformation or fake news, amplifying the potential for harm on a massive scale. Unfortunately, this happens quite a lot on X, which makes the platform the biggest source of fake news and disinformation. (<a href="#suciu-2023">Suciu, 2023</a>)</p>
                        <p>Introducing a viewing limit on each post would prevent posts from going viral and stop the spread of misinformation. When the limit of, for example, 100 views is reached, the post becomes blurry, rendering it unreadable, and it can no longer be retweeted. This approach would act as a speed bump in the rapid dissemination of content, encouraging users to engage more thoughtfully and reducing the potential for harmful or inaccurate information to gain traction.</p>

But for the engagement centric design most social media companies focus on, notifications play an essential role, as they depend on your attention and thus retention to their app. Studies analysing behaviour of mobile app users (<a href="#urban-airship-2017">Urban Airship, 2017</a>; <a href="#localytics-2018">Localytics, 2018</a>) suggests that notifications lead to a significant increase in app retention compared to those users, who disable notifications.</p>
                        <p>We want to differentiate between three types of notifications trigger wise. <emphasis>Transactional Notifications</emphasis> inform users of specific transactions that have been made in the background. Those could be purchase updates for example or in context of social media messages triggered by other user’s activity, let’s say they like your post. <emphasis>Promotional Notifications</emphasis> notify users about new marketing efforts made by the companies, for example discounts or new products. However, also those alerts, just checking in on the user with an arbitrary reason can be accounted for this type. Last, <emphasis>User-Triggered Notifications</emphasis> are those that are triggered by the user themself, for example unfinished processes like a full shopping cart without a final order. (<a href="#naylor-2024">Naylor, 2024</a>)</p>
                        <p>Further, we will focus separately on push notifications that will appear outside your app as well as those that act inside the app, which can but do not need to correspond in trigger, but also purpose as some might merely aim to gain attention while others will target emotions such as satisfaction or gratification (<a href="#goldman-2021">Goldman, 2021</a>).</p>

                        <p>These notifications popping up on our screens have become such a routine part of daily life that we don’t notice how they keep us engaged with our phones. While most seem to be notifying you of activity and transactions, they all have in common that they are also of promotional value. Sometimes, it seems that the reason for the notification is so far-fetched, you start wondering if it is really about your user experience, like this Reddit user: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/p04gfv/solved_the_mystery_of_random_crap_in_notifications/">“Solved the mystery of random crap in notifications”</a>. As mentioned above, the platform highly depends on notifications that drive user engagement and retention. They are thus interested in keeping sending you notifications to not let the platform fade from your mind. As Nir Eyal points out (<a href="#eyal-2014">2014</a>), products can form use habits by letting you run through a cycle of four stages called hook repeatedly. Each hook starts with a trigger, which can consist of a notification on your lock screen. By acting on that trigger, the user invests in their future experience on the platform, e.g. by providing data for personalization and then is rewarded with a better experience. </p>
                        <p>Can there be such a thing as too many or pointless notifications? Studies (e.g. <a href="#gavilan-martineznavarro-2022">Gavilan & Martinez Navarro, 2022</a>) suggest, yes, after a certain frequency or being low in value, users get annoyed and switch them off. In contrast, a study published in 2024 on PMC, found out that fear of missing out (FoMO) increased, suggesting that turning off notifications may have downsides instead of improving digital well-being (<a href="#dekker-2024">Dekker, 2024</a>). Especially in social media, where notifications are of personal and emotional value, this could prevent users continuously from switching them off. Instead, we continue to receive reminders about everything that happens on the app, driving our engagement.</p>
                        <p>Based on this, we analyzed X’s different notifications and detected a high level of senseless content wanting the user to re-open the app. So why not approach this manipulative pattern with an urge for truth? Can we not promote the app without making up imaginary user interests that need to be served? We believe that especially for high engagement social media apps, only placing a small trigger, containing the app icon aside an absolutely meaningless copy, on the user's home screen will plant the urge to use the app into their minds or as Nir Eyal would say, form their habit of using X. </p>

                        <p><emphasis>In-App Notifications</emphasis> refer to the alerts that collect behind the well known bell icon. X's menu bar shows small blue badges reminding you of new posts, new messages, new likes, reposts, citations, comments, new everything, which trigger positive emotions, caused by the release of dopamine, in the user (<a href="#goldman-2021">Goldman, 2021</a>). Mainly other user’s interactions with your own content are important in this regard as they show the attention your virtual personality raises. This draws them further into the platform, actively encouraging deeper engagement with others on X, feeding into the reinforcement loops, we have discussed in Chapter 1.1 Interactions.</p>
                        <p>Now, picture the symbols raining into the screen from the outer world that they come from. Isn’t that such a nice feeling, seeing all those hearts, all the appreciation by peers and strangers for the 140 digits you had sent out before? As more and more notifications appear, the fallen symbols begin to pile up, slowly taking over the screen. This creates a cluttered and chaotic interface, making it harder for the user to focus. The very tool designed to grab attention and encourage engagement turns into a barrier, disrupting the flow and making more content unreadable. Over time, this buildup reflects the overwhelming and intrusive nature of constant notifications, transforming the user experience into a moment for reflection rather than mindless interaction.</p>

                        <h3>Time and Scrolling</h3> <!-- Better title? -->
                        <p>Have you heard about “Doom-Scrolling”? It refers to the habit of endlessly consuming content on a feed that never stops. Many of us are familiar with the satisfying feeling of switching off our minds and aimlessly scrolling through cute cat videos or other lighthearted content. However, this seemingly harmless activity also has its downsides, particularly for mental health. Over time, the trance-like state induced by endless scrolling can lead to increased anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation.</p>
                        <p>It is especially concerning for young adults, as studies have shown that prolonged social media use and features like infinite scrolling can exacerbate mental health issues by fostering addictive behaviors and reducing self-awareness. For instance, research highlights the connection between excessive screen time, content overload, and negative psychological outcomes (<a href="#apa-2024">APA, 2024</a>). Time is a crucial factor in the issue of doom-scrolling, serving both as an important indicator and a significant consequence of this behavior. The longer you scroll, the more engaging content you encounter, which in turn keeps you spending even more time on your phone.</p>
                        <p>On X, the endless scroll feature isn’t the only design choice aimed at boosting engagement. We also examined the autoplay function for reels. After watching a selected video on a user’s feed, the next reel seamlessly slides up from the bottom of the screen, taking center stage immediately. This design leaves users with little opportunity to disengage from the platform. Additionally, advertisements disguised as regular posts tailored to users’ preferences frequently appear within the feed, further driving engagement.</p>

                        <h4>Scrolling Intervention: Blurry Screen – Clear Mind?</h4>
                        <p>Social media features like infinite scroll make users lose track of time, become more engaged and less self-aware, which can also affect their memory. A human-computer-interaction study from Cornell University (<a href="#ruiz-molinaleon-heuer-2024">Ruiz, Molina León & Heuer, 2024</a>), looked at how adding small obstacles, called "design frictions," to a platform can reduce mindless scrolling.</p>
                        <p>As a possible approach we took the simple scrolling feature and shifted it into a new dimension. By gradually making the screen blurrier as the users scroll too quickly, they are forced to slow down in order to recognize the content in their feeds. With this, we introduce friction that disrupts the zombie-like consumption of content. People are forced to read posts one by one, preventing them from overwhelming themselves with information. This could transform mindless scrolling into a more self-aware browsing experience. In addition to that, we see the gradual blurring of the screen as a metaphor for how users can’t fully process content when scrolling too quickly. It visually represents the negative consequences of "doom scrolling" figuratively and offers an approach to work against it.</p>

                        <h4>Friction: A Literal Approach </h4>
                        <p>So often, we are talking about friction in a metaphorical sense. Cluttered interfaces, bad performance, cognitive load as well as purposely placed interventions, for example in screen time apps. But couldn-t we just implement friction in a non-metaphorical sense? Friction that feels real, feels physical?</p>
                        <p>This we explored in the endlessness of the linear social media feed: If the user scrolls too quickly, the screen becomes scrolling-interaction becomes continuously slower, or harder. It feels like the screen is becoming heavier and heavier, as the user is trying to drag it forward, clinching to the background it’s sitting on. Just as your mind is becoming heavier with the minute, with every bit of information you're consuming by the second. Only slowly the scrolling-speed is recovering, reflecting yourself processing the information.</p>

The features and interactions we engage with daily are not just neutral tools; they are powerful mechanisms that can either amplify division or foster understanding.</p>
                        <p>But this is just the beginning of the conversation. How can we, as designers, developers, and users, take responsibility for the digital spaces we inhabit?
