                        <!-- <span>What is engagement and what about its time aspect?</span> -->
                        Increasing engagement of your users with your product is an essential principle of the business model for the companies behind social media platforms, like X. Since most of these platforms are free to use and ad-financed, they rely on maximizing user visibility, which drives their constant pursuit of increasing the time users spend on their platforms (Center for Humane Technology, 2021). In other words, the user's attention becomes the currency with which they effectively pay these companies. This phenomenon is known as the attention economy, where our time, focus, and interactions are commodified to fuel the revenue streams of social networking companies (<a href="#burkeman">Burkeman, 2019</a>).

                    <p>
                        <!-- <span>How is engagement-centric design implemented?</span> -->
                        Engagement-centric design can contain different dimensions, such as algorithm-driven strategies, however, as we want to focus on interaction design, we can cook it down to three core strategies. First and foremost, platforms can drive engagement through interactions, such as the prominent like button or comments (source). Second, notifications are key for user retention and gratification (source). Finally, the ability to scroll infinitely through feeds subtly increases time spent on these platforms (source), a topic currently at the center of public debate, as short video reel/short/tiktok feeds have entered the consumer market by storm (source).

                        <!-- <span>What are the effects in regard to polarisation?</span> -->
                        Okay, but how does a highly engaging app affect political polarisation in discussion? A first simple but logical explanation for increased polarisation is the time spent on the platform. Those who spend more time on X, are exposed to more radical, hateful and polarized content (National Institute of Justice, 2023). At the same time those people of course interact more with posts of their peers, leading to positive feedback loops as these interactions shape their own future content, grouping users with similar opinions and thus reinforcing these of yourself. This phenomenon is called echo chambers or bubbles (source), which we will go more in depth in chapter structure of content. The third general argument for the correlation between engagement and polarisation is the fact that received engagement will drive user’s reach (X explains the mechanics here). This leads to radicalization of post content to evoke emotions in the viewers and provoke interaction, in its extreme form called engagement farming (Oestreicher, 2024).

                    <p>
                        But let’s look at these above-mentioned features of X in detail and shed light on the concrete interface design decisions that ultimately lead to an increased engagement with the platform.

                    <p>
                        X offers a set of options that let you interact with another user’s post. Most prominently in social media, we look at “liking”, represented by a heart on X. As the names suggest, these are one-dimensional “black and white” reactions on a post, which leads to the thought of more diverse reactions. Another important functionality is reposting, formerly retweeting, with which users can share posts with or without commenting on them in their own timeline and the feeds of their peers. Last, but maybe most well known for Twitter's (back then) discussion culture, we will discuss the threaded commenting functionality and propose alternative concepts that shed light on the polarizing effects the current implementation has on the community.
